The Viterbi algorithm. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a Markov chain where we cannot
observe the states directly, but we can observe the emissions. The Viterbi algorithm is used for
decoding the sequence of states, that is finding the most likely sequence of states that could give
rise to a sequence of observations. Given a set of states Q and a sequence of time points 1 . . . T , the
algorithm builds two matrices of size Q × (1 . . . T ): a probability matrix representing the probability
of each state at each time point, and a backpointer matrix which points from each state at each time
point to the most likely previous state. At the final time point T , the algorithm selects the state
with the highest probability, and returns the path of backpointers from that state, representing the
most likely sequence of states to give rise to the observations. The following is pseudocode for the
algorithm: the notation a(q 0 , q) represents the transition probability between states q 0 and q, and
b(q, o t ) represents the emission probability by state q of the observation noted at time t.


# Initialization step at t = 1
for q in Q :
	probability(q, 1) = a(q 0 , q) ∗ b(q, o 1 )
	backpointer(q, 1) = q 0
# Recursion step for the remaining time points
for t from 2 to T :
	for q in Q :
		probability(q,t) = max q 0 ∈Q probability(q 0 ,t − 1) ∗ a(q 0 , q) ∗ b(q, o t )
		backpointer(q,t) = arg max q 0 ∈Q probability(q 0 ,t − 1) ∗ a(q 0 , q)
# Termination step
most probable state(T ) = arg max q 0 ∈Q probability(q 0 , T )
return the backtrace path by following the backpointers from the most probable state
